# kafkaesque-pkgbuild

UNOFFICIAL naive PKGBUILD to install https://github.com/patschuh/KafkaEsque on Arch Linux, shamelessly based on the Debian distribution provided by upstream.

No warranty whatsoever, but I use it myself so it will most likely be fine. This likely doesn't follow all best practices, and I didn't really verify the required libraries (mainly copied/translated the dependencies of the deb, which seem to be auto-generated by the build tool used upstream).

I'm loosely planning to maybe upload this to the AUR or upstream, but it would be my first package & I haven't familiarised myself with the detailed guidelines and workflow yet. If there is demand, let me know.

Please note that as per upstream, this installs a JRE in `/opt/kafkaesque`, which is not necessarily space-efficient (145M at the time of writing), but obviously more robust, so this implementation decision is kept.

Questions/suggestions welcome, just open an issue on GitHub or contact me using the channels shown on my website.

# How to install

See: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Creating_packages

```bash
makepkg --install
```

It is possible to sanity-check the PKGBUILD using `namcap`.

# License
The PKGBUILD itself isn't all that complicated & licensed under MIT, which should be sufficiently permissive.

Please note that upstream is licensed as GPL v3 at the time of writing, i.e. a different license. This information may change, please check upstream for authoritative information.
